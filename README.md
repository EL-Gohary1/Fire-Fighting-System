# Fire-Fighting-System
## The system can operate in three modes: Fine mode, activated when the temperature is above 50Â°C with a 10% hysteresis, switches to heat mode. In this mode, it reads the smoke sensor; if the reading exceeds 40%, it switches to fire mode, activates the water pump and alarm buzzer, and displays the temperature and mode on the LCD screen. The project was developed using AT-mega 32.
